## 🔍 Overview

MiniMe-LLM is an educational project focused on building a minimal implementation of a Large Language Model from scratch. This project aims to provide a clear, understandable codebase that demonstrates the core concepts behind LLMs without the complexity of production-scale implementations.

**⚠️ Current Status**: This project is in early development. The current version contains basic project scaffolding and placeholder functionality.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Minimal Implementation**: Focus on core LLM concepts without unnecessary complexity
- 📚 **Educational Focus**: Well-documented code designed for learning
- 🛠️ **Modern Python**: Built with Python 3.9+ and modern tooling
- 📦 **Easy Setup**: Simple installation and dependency management

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip or uv package manager

### Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thisguymartin/MiniMe-LLM.git
cd MiniMe-LLM

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thisguymartin/MiniMe-LLM.git
cd MiniMe-LLM

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

After installation, you can run the basic example:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Note**: The current implementation is a placeholder. Actual LLM functionality is planned for future releases.

## 💡 Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from minime_llm import MiniMeLLM

# This is a planned API - not yet implemented
model = MiniMeLLM()
response = model.generate("Hello, world!")
print(response)
```

### Training (Planned)

```python
# Planned functionality for training custom models
from minime_llm import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(model_config="config.yaml")
trainer.train(dataset="path/to/dataset")
```
